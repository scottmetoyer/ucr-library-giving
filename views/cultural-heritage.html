                The UCR Library is the second-largest student employer on the UC Riverside campus. We are also the place
                students turn to
                when it's time to study for finals and to collaborate with like-minded colleagues as they work toward
                their
                dreams. We provide the space, the resources, and the guidance that our students need to succeed.
