                The UCR Library has the goal to create dynamic learning spaces that propel the universityâ€™s research and learning objectives forward by providing diverse environments for information-based academic inquiry. We also create physical and virtual spaces for dynamically creative interaction, group study, innovation and knowledge creation, as well as quiet contemplative study.

            text="The UCR Library makes its impressive collections available to the public through regularly rotating exhibitions. Exhibits provide dynamic interfaces that connect intellectual and artistic content to users in engaging and meaningful ways, enhancing critical thinking while showcasing our cultural heritage materials.<br><br>
            Currently all exhibition activities, including curation and creation, are accomplished by UCR Library staff in Special Collections in addition to their other duties. An Exhibition Developer would enable us to move into a broader range of exhibition activities, including expanding our reach into digital exhibitions. Contributions to this meaningful fund will enable the Library to make the exhibit developer a full time position."
