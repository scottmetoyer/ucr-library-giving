                The UCR Library empowers positive change by bringing together diverse individuals, communities and information to advance research, education, and innovation. In particular, our special collections of science fiction, fantasy, horror, utopian literature and related genres (including fan literature and anime) have become a major resource for research and inspiration by UCR scholars as well as those around the world.
