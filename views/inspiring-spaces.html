                The UCR Library has the goal to create dynamic learning spaces that propel the universityâ€™s research and learning objectives forward by providing diverse environments for information-based academic inquiry. We also create physical and virtual spaces for dynamically creative interaction, group study, innovation and knowledge creation, as well as quiet contemplative study.
